I am passionate about technology and learning new skills that can help me deliver better outcomes for customers and the company. I hold an MBA in IT Management and two Microsoft certifications (MCITP and MCSA) in Windows Server and Exchange Server. I am also pursuing two postgraduate degrees in Data Science and Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Texas McCombs School of Business. My goal is to apply my knowledge and expertise in these fields to enhance the performance and functionality of Tableau products and services.
